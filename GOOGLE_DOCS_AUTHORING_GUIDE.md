# Google Docs Authoring Guide for Emirates Document-Based Authoring

This guide explains how to author content in Google Docs for the Emirates website's Teaser and Carousel blocks. Both blocks have been optimized for document-based authoring to provide an intuitive authoring experience.

## Overview

Document-based authoring allows content creators to use familiar Google Docs interfaces to create rich web content. The system automatically converts your document structure into functional web components.

---

## üéØ Teaser Block

The Teaser block creates visually appealing content sections with images and text in side-by-side layouts.

### Basic Structure

Create a table in Google Docs with the following structure:

```
| teaser |
| image-left |
| [Your Image] |
| # Your Heading |
| Your description text here |
| Learn More ‚Üí https://example.com |
```

### Configuration Options

#### Layout Direction
Add one of these configuration values in a single cell:

- `image-left` - Image on left, content on right (default)
- `content-left` - Content on left, image on right
- `text-left` - Alternative syntax for content-left
- `photo-left` - Alternative syntax for image-left

#### Traditional Configuration (Alternative)
You can also use key-value pairs:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| layout | image-left |
| image-alt | Custom alt text |
| cta-text | Custom button text |
| cta-link | https://example.com |

### Content Elements

#### 1. Images
- Add images directly in any cell
- First image found becomes the teaser image
- Images are automatically optimized with lazy loading
- If no alt text is provided, a default is used

#### 2. Headings
- Use any heading level (H1-H6) in Google Docs
- First heading found becomes the main teaser heading
- Automatically converted to H2 for consistency

#### 3. Description Text
- Add paragraphs, lists, or formatted text
- All non-image, non-heading content becomes description
- Supports rich formatting (bold, italic, links)

#### 4. Call-to-Action (CTA)
The system automatically detects CTA links based on text content:

**Auto-detected CTA keywords:**
- "Learn More"
- "Read More" 
- "Discover"
- "Explore"
- "Book Now"
- "View"
- "See More"

**Manual CTA Configuration:**
| cta-text | Learn More |
| cta-link | https://emirates.com/destinations |

### Complete Example

```
| teaser |
| content-left |
| # Discover Dubai |
| Experience the magic of Dubai with Emirates. From stunning skyscrapers to golden beaches, Dubai offers unforgettable experiences for every traveler. |
| Book Your Adventure ‚Üí https://emirates.com/book |
| [Dubai skyline image] |
```

### Best Practices

1. **Image Quality**: Use high-resolution images (min 1200px wide)
2. **Alt Text**: Provide descriptive alt text for accessibility
3. **Heading Length**: Keep headlines concise (under 60 characters)
4. **Description**: Aim for 2-3 sentences for optimal readability
5. **CTA Text**: Use action-oriented language

## üé† Carousel Block

The Carousel block creates interactive slideshows with navigation, auto-play, and touch support.

### Basic Structure

Create a table with configuration and slide content:

```
| carousel |
| title: Featured Destinations |
| autoplay: true |
| interval: 5 |
| [Slide 1 Image] |
| # Paris |
| The City of Light awaits |
| [Slide 2 Image] |
| # Tokyo |
| Modern meets traditional |
```

### Configuration Options

#### Single-Cell Configuration (Recommended)
Add configuration in separate cells:

- `autoplay: true/false` - Enable automatic slide progression
- `interval: 5` - Seconds between slides (default: 5)
- `title: Carousel Title` - Optional carousel heading
- `style: hero` - Visual variant (default, cards, hero, testimonials)
- `show-dots: true/false` - Navigation dots (default: true)
- `show-arrows: true/false` - Navigation arrows (default: true)
- `loop: true/false` - Loop back to first slide (default: true)

#### Traditional Configuration (Alternative)
| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| title | Featured Destinations |
| autoplay | true |
| interval | 8 |
| variant | hero |
| showDots | true |
| showArrows | true |
| loop | true |

### Slide Content

Each row in your document (after configuration) becomes a slide. Slides support:

#### 1. Image + Text Slides (Most Common)
```
| [Your Image] # Slide Title | Description text here |
```

#### 2. Image-Only Slides
```
| [Your Image Only] |
```

#### 3. Text-Only Slides
```
| # Slide Title | Your slide content here with rich formatting |
```

#### 4. Rich Content Slides
```
| [Image] # Welcome to Emirates | 
Discover world-class service and comfort. 
**Book now** for exclusive offers.
Explore Destinations ‚Üí https://emirates.com |
```

### Slide Types & Auto-Detection

The system automatically categorizes slides:

- **Media-Text Slide**: Contains both images/video and text
- **Media Slide**: Contains only images or video
- **Text Slide**: Contains only text content

### CTA Detection in Slides

Like teasers, carousels auto-detect CTAs with keywords:
- "Learn More", "Read More", "Discover", "Explore"
- "Book Now", "View", "See More", "Shop Now", "Get Started"

### Complete Example

```
| carousel |
| title: Explore the World with Emirates |
| autoplay: true |
| interval: 6 |
| style: hero |
| [Paris Eiffel Tower image] |
| # Paris, France |
| Experience the romance and elegance of the City of Light. From world-class museums to charming caf√©s. |
| Discover Paris ‚Üí https://emirates.com/destinations/paris |
| [Tokyo skyline image] |
| # Tokyo, Japan |
| Where ancient traditions meet cutting-edge innovation in perfect harmony. |
| Explore Tokyo ‚Üí https://emirates.com/destinations/tokyo |
| [New York image] |
| # New York, USA |
| The city that never sleeps offers endless possibilities and iconic experiences. |
| Book NYC ‚Üí https://emirates.com/destinations/nyc |
```

### Best Practices

1. **Slide Count**: 3-7 slides work best for user engagement
2. **Content Consistency**: Keep slide content length similar
3. **Image Aspect Ratio**: Use consistent aspect ratios (16:9 recommended)
4. **Auto-play**: Use sparingly - consider accessibility
5. **Text Overlay**: Ensure good contrast between text and background images

## üõ†Ô∏è Validation & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Teaser Block
- **No image showing**: Check image placement and format
- **Wrong layout**: Verify layout configuration spelling
- **Missing CTA**: Use recognized keywords or manual configuration

#### Carousel Block
- **No slides detected**: Each slide needs substantial content (30+ characters)
